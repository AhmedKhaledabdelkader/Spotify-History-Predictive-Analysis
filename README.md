# Spotify-History-Predictive-Analysis
Analyzed personal Spotify listening history to understand music preferences, listening trends, and engagement patterns. A machine learning model was developed to predict whether a song was skipped, adding a smart layer of insight into user behavior beyond basic statistics.

Skills, Tools & Techniques Used
ðŸ§  Programming & Libraries
Python â€“ Main language for data manipulation and modeling

Pandas â€“ Data preprocessing, pipeline building, feature engineering

NumPy â€“ Numerical operations

Scikit-learn â€“ Modeling, pipelines, preprocessing, and evaluation

ðŸ”„ Data Engineering & Pipelines
Data Cleaning & Wrangling â€“ From raw JSON to structured format

Scikit-learn Pipelines â€“ Streamlined data processing and modeling flow

Custom Transformers â€“ For modular and reusable steps (e.g., skip detection logic)

Cyclic Feature Encoding â€“ Encoded time-based features like hour/day using sine & cosine transforms

ðŸ“Š Feature Engineering
Ordinal Encoding & One-Hot Encoding â€“ For categorical variables

Cyclic Encoding â€“ For time features (hour, day, month) to capture periodicity

Interaction Features â€“ Combining fields like "user-hour" or "track-duration"

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
Classification Models â€“ To predict if a track was skipped (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

 Cross-Validation â€“ For reliable model evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Used GridSearchCV to optimize model performance

Model Evaluation â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization & Analysis
Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly â€“ For EDA and visualizing trends

Time-Series Analysis â€“ Analyze behavior over hour/day/month

User Behavior Patterns â€“ Identified skip behavior, top tracks, and listening sessions

At the end i deployed the model using flask framework
